## Dataset

We have selected red wine quality csv dataset from Kaggle.   
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset    

This dataset contains information about chemical composition of red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.   

## Objective  
Build machine learning model to predict wine quality based on its chemical composition.  

## Different models used  
1. Random Forest  
2. Dimension reduction neural network  
3. Linear regression  
4. Decision tree  

## Conclusion
